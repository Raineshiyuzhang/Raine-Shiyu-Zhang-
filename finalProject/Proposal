For the final project, I want to create a ‘Dancing Platform’.

The object will include 2 Arduino, 2 motors, 1 or 2 light sensor, several LEDs, and other support materials.
Arduino1 will control motor1 and all LEDS;
Arduino2 will control motor2 and sensors;

Object will involve as two layout.

Layout1 (lower) motor1 controls a circle platform1; 
LEDs all around the rim of the platform; 
LEDs will be controlled by program in serval arrays; 
Motor1 keep rotating in one direction. 
Two light sensors will be fixed on platform1.

Layout2 (upper) motor2 controls a smaller circle platform2; 
‘Dancers’ and other structures will shown on the platform2;
Light sensors will respond to these structures. 

Light sensor1 controls direction;
Light sensor2 controls speed.

The object will use battery for power
